Project 4
	server and client
by the end all messages should be encrypted 

PART ONE
	just setting up the chat messages
	server needs to do multiple clients at the same time
	server should print list of all other clients
	Administrative commands - kick clients off if they do something bad
	Any thing the server can do the client should get a message that is connected with that
		-can be terminal
***TIPS***************************
	DIFFERENCE with threads - these threads might access the same data structures
		SO one thread might modify and the other thread is trying to access
		JAVA make syncronized blocks - on the same object.
			-Hash Maps have problems with this
			ConcurrentHashMap pretty much the same but WITHOUT the problem (99% replacement - doesn't like null)
			-there is also a arraylist version of this -maybe for the list of clients that are on
				-List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());
			-the collections classes have this issue but there are always solutions to the problems
			
*****ideas****
have mapped to a name/num so a client can send to a name instead of the ip address
